The simpleReactingParticleFoam solver has solver has been replaced by the more
general reactingFoam solver, which supports buoyant compressible
reacting flow coupled to multiple run-time-selectable lagrangian clouds and
surface film modelling.

To run a simpleReactingParticleFoam case in reactingFoam add the following entries
in constant/fvModels:

buoyancyForce
{
    type        buoyancyForce;
}

clouds
{
    type    clouds;
    libs    ("liblagrangianParticle.so");
}

which add the acceleration due to gravity needed by Lagrangian clouds and the
clouds themselves.

See the following case for an example converted from simpleReactingParticleFoam:
