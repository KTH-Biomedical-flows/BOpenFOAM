#
# Description
#     Script to inform the user that interPhaseChangeFoam has been replaced
#     by the more general interFoam solver.

cat << EOF

The interPhaseChangeFoam solver has solver has been replaced by the more general
interFoam solver, which now supports phase-change using the new twoPhaseChange
models library.

To run with with phase-change create a constant/phaseChangeProperties dictionary
containing the phase-change model specification, e.g.

    phaseChangeModel SchnerrSauer;

    pSat            2300;   // Saturation pressure

See the following cases for an example converted from interPhaseChangeFoam:
