# Description
#     Script to inform the user that compressibleInterFilmFoam has been replaced
#     by the more general compressibleInterFoam solver with a special fvModel.

cat << EOF

The compressibleInterFilmFoam solver has solver has been replaced by the more general
compressibleInterFoam solver, which now supports surface films using the new
VoFSurfaceFilm fvModel.

To run with with surface film create a system/fvModels dictionary
containing the VoFSurfaceFilm specification, e.g.

    VoFSurfaceFilm
    {
        type    VoFSurfaceFilm;

        phase   water;
    }
